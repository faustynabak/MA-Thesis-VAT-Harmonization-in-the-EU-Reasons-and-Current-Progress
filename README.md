# MA-Thesis-VAT-Harmonization-in-the-EU-Reasons-and-Current-Progress
The aim of this master’s thesis is to analyze the process of harmonization of the value-added tax (VAT) within the European Union and the implementation of its principles in Poland, as well as to assess the impact of this process on the Polish legal and economic system. The scope  of the study includes the legal foundations of VAT harmonization in the EU (provisions of the  Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and VAT directives), the adaptation of Polish tax law to EU regulations, and an analysis of the effects of harmonization on Poland’s tax system and economy. The applied methodology encompasses an analysis of legal acts, an examination of  empirical data concerning, among other things, VAT revenues and the VAT gap, as well as a review of the relevant literature. The results of the analysis indicate that VAT harmonization  has brought significant legal, fiscal, and economic benefits to Poland. Harmonization ensures  the compliance of national regulations with EU law, enhancing legal certainty and removing  legal barriers to intra-EU trade. It also contributes to the stabilization of state budget revenues and improves the efficiency of tax collection by reducing tax fraud, while facilitating cross border transactions and strengthening the competitiveness of Polish enterprises within the single European market.
